I am Kanad (pronounced: Kanād), a second-year Ph.D. student in the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University. I am co-advised by Aarti Singh and Bryan Wilder.\nI am broadly interested in statistical ML, online learning, and game theory. More specifically, I am excited by problems in sequential decision-making, causal inference, and anything statistical! I am currently looking at human and algorithmic decision-making from a statistical perspective. You can find my resume (updated Oct 2025) here.\nI was previously a Master’s in Machine Learning student at CMU for a year, after which I switched to the Ph.D. program. Prior to that, spent four wonderful years as an undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay. I majored in Computer Science (Honors with Minor in Applied Statistics and Informatics), conducting research with Sunita Sarawagi.\nI have interned at NUS, Adobe Research and IRISA.\nI love discussing ideas of any and all kinds, and am particularly susceptible to being nerd sniped. I’m open to talk about exciting ideas anytime!\n\n\n\n\n\nIn my free time, I love reading books, playing sports, and hiking. I’m very big on music, listening to a variety of genres, and I enjoy singing too!\nYou can contact me at kpardesh [at] andrew [dot] cmu [dot] edu."
