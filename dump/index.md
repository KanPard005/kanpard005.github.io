# Who Am I?
Hi! I'm a fourth-year undergraduate in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. Being very passionate about statistics, artificial intelligence and machine learning, I'm driven to conduct highly impactful research in these fields.

To achieve this (rather ambitious) goal, I've completed a minor degree in Applied Statistics and Informatics. I'm also pursuing an honors degree, and have completed advanced electives in image processing, reinforcement learning and machine learning in the process.

Apart from this, I'm an avid reader, and love to read non-fiction and comedy. I'm also an enormous sports buff, regularly playing tennis and following Formula 1!
