# Who Am I?
Hi! I'm a fourth-year undergraduate in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. Being very passionate about statistics, artificial intelligence and machine learning, I'm driven to conduct highly impactful research in these fields.

To achieve this (rather ambitious) goal, I've completed a minor degree in Applied Statistics and Informatics. I'm also pursuing an honors degree, and have completed advanced electives in image processing, reinforcement learning and machine learning in the process.

Apart from this, I'm an avid reader, and love to read non-fiction and comedy. I'm also an enormous sports buff, regularly playing tennis and following Formula 1!

# Research Experience
- I'm currently working on my Bachelor's Thesis Project with Prof Sunita Sarawagi. We are working on **improving diffusion models** for generation tasks, especially text generation. There has been active interest in diffusion models in recent literature, as they are shown to outperform GANs, but these methods, when applied in a non-autoregressive setting, still fall far behind autoregressive techniques. We are aiming to address this research gap.
- I've conducted a seminar study with Prof Sunita Sarawagi on **energy-based models for text generation**. This was a semester-long review of state-of-the-art literature concerning energy-based models (EBMs) and generative flow networks. I studied various papers about how recent methods are circumventing the shortcomings of EBMs when it comes to text. Here are the slides of my presentation.
- In the summer of 2022, I interned at Adobe Research India. I worked with Dr Vishwa Vinay on adding a user-based control for textual descriptions of images. This was a very valuable experience, since our team got to formulate the research problem from scratch (right from conducting an extensive literature review), come up with feasible solutions, and then implement the solution, culminating in a prototype website showcasing our product.
- In my junior year, I worked as a research intern under the guidance of Prof Blaise Genest and Prof Eric Fabre at IRISA, France, along with Prof Alessandro Abate at the University of Oxford. We worked on improving the explainability of policies learnt in reinforcement learning. Our focus was on deep Q-networks, and as neural networks are notoriously hard to verify formally, we were trying to approximate it using support vector machines (SVMs).
- In October 2022, I attended the week-long Descartes School at NUS, Singapore. This was organized by CNRS@CREATE, a collaboration between CNRS, France and NUS, Singapore. I learnt about the various applications of AI in critical decision-making systems in urban settings. I also participated in activities concerning the psychological, ethical and legal aspects of AI, and this helped me develop a more holistic perspective about the field.

# Positions of Responsibility
- I'm associated with The Apprentice Project (TAP), an award-winning NGO focussed on imparting quality extracurricular education to students from low-income families in the state of Maharashtra. As a content development specialist, I'm involved in creating interesting videos about basic electronics, in which I explain concepts to the children through activities which they do as well.
- I'm currently a teaching assistant at IIT Bombay for CS 101, the introductory programming course offered to all fresher students. I'm involved in conducting and designing labs, along with helping out 15 students in a more direct manner.
- During winter 2020, I was involved with Jnana Prabodhini Foundation's (JPF's) Analytics wing, where we set out to understand the knowledge, attitudes and practices prevalent in Pune city concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. This involved designing surveys and analyzing their responses.
