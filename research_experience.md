# What have I researched in?
- I'm currently working on my Bachelor's Thesis Project with **Prof Sunita Sarawagi**. We are working on **improving diffusion models** for generation tasks, especially text generation. There has been active interest in diffusion models in recent literature, as they are shown to outperform GANs, but these methods, when applied in a non-autoregressive setting, still fall far behind autoregressive techniques. We are aiming to address this research gap.
- I've conducted a seminar study with **Prof Sunita Sarawagi** on **energy-based models for text generation**. This was a semester-long review of state-of-the-art literature concerning energy-based models (EBMs) and generative flow networks. I studied various papers about how recent methods are circumventing the shortcomings of EBMs when it comes to text. Here are the slides to my presentation.
- In the summer of 2022, I interned at **Adobe Research India**. I worked with **Dr Vishwa Vinay** on adding a user-based control for **textual descriptions of images**. This was a very valuable experience, since our team got to formulate the research problem from scratch (right from conducting an extensive literature review), come up with feasible solutions, and then implement the solution, culminating in a prototype website showcasing our product.
- In my junior year, I worked as a research intern under the guidance of **Prof Blaise Genest** and **Prof Eric Fabre** at IRISA, France, along with **Prof Alessandro Abate** at the University of Oxford. We worked on improving the **explainability of policies learnt in reinforcement learning**. Our focus was on deep Q-networks, and as neural networks are notoriously hard to verify formally, we were trying to approximate it using support vector machines (SVMs).
- In October 2022, I attended the week-long **Descartes School** at NUS, Singapore. This was organized by CNRS@CREATE, a collaboration between CNRS, France and NUS, Singapore. I learnt about the various applications of **AI in critical decision-making systems in urban settings**. I also participated in activities concerning the psychological, ethical and legal aspects of AI, and this helped me develop a more holistic perspective about the field.
