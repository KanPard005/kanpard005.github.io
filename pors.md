# How am I giving back?
- I'm associated with **The Apprentice Project (TAP)**, an award-winning NGO focussed on imparting quality extracurricular education to students from low-income families in the state of Maharashtra. As a **content development specialist**, I'm involved in creating interesting videos about basic electronics, in which I explain concepts to the children through activities which they do as well.
- I'm currently a **teaching assistant** at IIT Bombay for **CS 101**, the introductory programming course offered to all fresher students. I'm involved in conducting and designing labs, along with helping out 15 students in a more direct manner.
- During winter 2020, I was involved with Jnana Prabodhini Foundation's (JPF's) Analytics wing, where we set out to understand the **knowledge**, **attitudes** and **practices** prevalent in Pune city concerning the **COVID-19 pandemic**. This involved designing surveys and analyzing their responses.
