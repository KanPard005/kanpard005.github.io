Hello! I am Kanad (pronounced: KanƒÅd), a first-year Ph.D. student in the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University. I am co-advised by [[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aarti/][Aarti Singh]] and [[https://bryanwilder.github.io/][Bryan Wilder]].

I am broadly interested in statistical ML, ML theory and ML algorithms. More specifically, I am excited by problems in sequential decision-making, causal inference, and anything statistical! You can find my CV (updated Jan 2024) [[file:assets/pdfs/CV_Kanad_Pardeshi.pdf][here]]. 

I was previously a Master's in Machine Learning student at CMU for a year, after which I switched to the Ph.D. program. Prior to that, I did my undergraduate in Computer Science (with Honors and a Minor in Applied Statistics and Informatics)from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.


I love discussing ideas and am particularly susceptible to being [[https://xkcd.com/356/][nerd sniped]]:

In my free time, I love reading books, playing sports, and have recently started exploring the piano!

You can contact me at kpardesh [at] andrew [dot] cmu [dot] edu.
