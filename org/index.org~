Welcome to my webpage! I am Kanad Pardeshi, a first-year Ph.D. student in the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University. I am co-advised by Aarti Singh (add link) and Bryan Wilder (add link).

I am broadly interested in statistical ML, ML theory and ML algorithms. More specifically, I am excited by problems in sequential decision-making, causal inference, and anything statistical!

I love discussing ideas, and am particularly susceptible to being nerd sniped. In my free time, I love reading books, playing sports, and have recently started exploring the piano!

You can contact me at kpardesh [at] andrew [dot] cmu [dot] edu.
