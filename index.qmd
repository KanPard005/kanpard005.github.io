Hello! I am Kanad (pronounced: KanƒÅd), a second-year Ph.D. student in the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University. I am co-advised by [Aarti Singh](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aarti/) and [Bryan Wilder](https://bryanwilder.github.io/).

I am broadly interested in statistical ML, ML theory and ML algorithms. More specifically, I am excited by problems in sequential decision-making, causal inference, and anything statistical! You can find my Resume (updated Oct 2025) [here](file:assets/pdfs/kanad_onepage.pdf). 

I was previously a Master's in Machine Learning student at CMU for a year, after which I switched to the Ph.D. program. Prior to that, spent four wonderful years as an undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay. I majored in Computer Science (Honors with Minor in Applied Statistics and Informatics), conducting research with [Sunita Sarawagi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~sunita/).

I have interned at NUS, Adobe Research and IRISA.

I love discussing ideas of any and all kinds, and am particularly susceptible to being [nerd sniped](https://xkcd.com/356/). I'm open to talk about exciting ideas anytime!

In my free time, I love reading books, playing sports, and hiking. I'm very big on music, listening to a variety of genres, and I enjoy singing too!
